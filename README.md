# Notebook
This module adds new tab named "Notebook" to the right sidebar. Both players and GMs can create small notes here and share them with others.

### Basic notes
Basic notes have a title and can be colored for easier recognition. The GM can always see all notes and also delete them. The owner (the user who created the note) may choose who can see and who can edit the note. The notes may be reordered via drag and drop and can be closed by clicking on the black title bar to minimize them.

Please note, that the notes are saved per user. To edit a note you have have access to, either the owner or the note or a GM has to be online.

Multiple types of notes are available:

- #### Text notes:
  A simple note that allows you share small texts

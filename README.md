# Notebook
This module adds new tab named "Notebook" to the right sidebar. Both players and GMs can create small notes here and share them with others.

### Basic notes
Basic notes have a title and can be colored for easier recognition. The GM can always see all notes and also delete them. The owner (the user who created the note) may choose who can see and who can edit the note. The notes may be reordered via drag and drop and can be minimized by clicking on the black title bar.

Please note, that the notes are saved per user. To edit a note you have access to, either the owner of the note or a GM has to be online.

Multiple types of notes are available:

- #### Text notes:
  A simple note that allows you share small texts
  
- #### Counter notes:
  A note to count, well, something. You can add or subtract using the "+" and "-" buttons to the left and to the right. Holding shift or alt will alter the amount changed by using the buttons and holding the buttons will quickly increase or decrease the value. The value can also be set directly by writing into the counter. A maximum can also be set by entering a "/" followed by the maximum into the counter.

- #### List notes:
  A note to list some items. The items can be checked/unchecked or removed.

- #### Slider notes:
  A value slider. The value can be set via the slider or via the input to the right. By hovering over the bar at the bottom a menu will open, allowing you to set maximum, minimum and step size of the slider.

- #### Chat notes:
  A chat notes allowing all users that can edit the notes to chat with all users that can see the note. The chat colors are based on the user colors.

- #### Timer notes:
  A timer that counts even while the user of offline or the server is down. The time (seconds, minutes, hours and days(top left)) can be set directly by entering the values. Using the menu to right, that appears when hovering over the note, the direction in which the timer ticks can be chosen (up or down), the timer can be started or paused, and the timer can be reset to 0 (if the timer ticks up) or reset to the last manually set time (of the timer ticks down).

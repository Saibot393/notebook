# Notebook
This module adds a new tab named "Notebook" to the right sidebar. Both players and GMs can create small notes here and share them with others.

### Basic notes
Basic notes have a title and can be colored for easier recognition. The GM can always see all notes and also delete them. The owner (the user who created the note) may choose who can see and who can edit the note. The notes may be reordered via drag and drop and can be minimized by clicking on the black title bar. The notes can also be expanded into seperate windows by using the popout symbol in the notes title bar. To copy a note, you can shift+right-click the title bar (the copies permissions will be reset).

Certain notes (text, list, chat) can be copied into journals via drag and drop. 

##### Please note:
  - The notes are saved per user. To edit a note you have access to, either the owner of the note or a GM has to be online.
  - The folder structure is per user and is not snyched. Every user can have their own folders for their own purposes

##### Multiple types of notes are available:

- #### Text notes:
  A simple note that allows you to share small texts

- #### Counter notes:
  A note to count, well, something. You can add or subtract using the "+" and "-" buttons to the left and to the right. Holding shift or alt will alter the amount changed by using the buttons and holding the buttons will quickly increase or decrease the value. The value can also be set directly by writing into the counter. A maximum can also be set by entering a "/" followed by the maximum into the counter.

  A note to list some items. The items can be checked/unchecked or removed. The notes can be indented using Tab or shift + Tab and can be reordered using drag and drop. The check state of sub states can be set using right-click.

- #### Timer notes:
  A timer that counts even while the user is offline or the server is down. The time (seconds, minutes, hours and days(top left)) can be set directly by entering the values. Using the menu to the right, that appears when hovering over the note, the direction in which the timer ticks can be chosen (up or down), the timer can be started or paused, and the timer can be reset to 0 (if the timer ticks up) or reset to the last manually set time (if the timer ticks down).
